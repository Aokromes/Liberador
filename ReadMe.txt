ReadMe for Trinity MaNGOS SDK v.0.3

TMSDK is released under the GNU/GPL v.3.
TMSDK is a series of classes written in PHP meant to let people easily
develope tools and sites based off the MaNGOS or Trinity projects.

In order to get TMSDK work, you'll need to copy
tmsdk.*.php files somewhere in your project and modify the PROJECT define
in tmsdk.class.php as specified. Note thet msdk.class.php is there just for retro-compatibility and it's not supported. It will be deleted somewhere in the near future.

Please report credits to the original developers if you want to use these
classes; an easy way to do this is to use the tmsdk::getAuthor function.
